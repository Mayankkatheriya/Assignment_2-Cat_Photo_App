h1 :  Main heading or title of a web page.

h2 : Subheading or section heading within the web page structure.

p : Paragraph element for containing and displaying text content.

a href : The 'a' tag (or anchor tag) is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to other web pages or resources.

The 'id' attribute inside an 'a' tag is used to give the anchor a unique identifier. It is commonly used when creating internal links or to target specific elements using JavaScript or CSS. With the 'id' attribute, you can refer to the specific element within the same page using a URL fragment identifier (e.g., #section1).

img : The img tag is used to embed images into a web page. It allows you to display pictures, illustrations, icons, and other graphical content on your website.

Attribute:

src : Specifies the URL or file path of the image.
alt : Provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or for accessibility purposes (screen readers).

ul : The 'ul' tag is used to create an unordered list in HTML. It represents a list of items where the order of the items does not matter, and the list items are typically marked with bullet points.

type attribute : This optional attribute is used to specify the type of bullet or numbering style used for the list items. It is not commonly used with unordered lists (ul) since the default style is typically bullet points. However, it can be used with ordered lists (ol) to customize the numbering style.



The img tag in HTML has two essential attributes:

src: Specifies the image URL or file path.
alt: Provides alternative text for accessibility and when the image cannot be displayed.
